    <!-- Meet Miss Stats Tile Text -->

    <string name="meetMissStats">Miss Stats is the Statistics teacher everyone would be happy to meet, even who ignore what Statistics is.
 Her mission is to spread the knowledge of Statistics everywhere with simple and  effective words and above all with the help of many, many examples.
 Once, many years ago, I told her (I even don\'t remember about what): \"Miss Stats, this is really impossible for me, this would never happen!\", but she answered me, and
 I have never forgot it: \"Nothing is impossible. There are only things extremely improbable\" and then she calculated with extremely precision what my chance were.
 No problem, big or small, can scare Miss Stats, her motto is always \"Give me enough data and I will give you the solution\".
 Numbers, according to Miss Stats, are very often undervalued, somebody think they are useful only for calculating results, ma this isn\'t true: if you observe them with attention,
 like a true detective, they can tell you incredible stories and disclose entire secret worlds.
 Follow Miss Stats through this app, you won\'t regret it!</string>
